            <p>Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower
                down to their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to chomp away on
                bamboo!</p>

            <p>According to legend, the panda was once an all-white bear. When a small girl tried to save a
                panda cub from being attacked by a leopard, the leopard killed the girl instead. Pandas came
                to her funeral wearing armbands of black ashes. As they wiped their eyes, hugged each other,
                and covered the ears, they smudged the black ashes.</p>

            <p>Giant panda cubs are usually born in August or September and are the size of a stick of
                butter. A cub has pink skin, a thin coat of white fur, a long tail, and no teeth. Its
                eyes are closed. By the end of the first month, the baby panda has all of its spots. Its
                eyes open around 4-6 weeks. A baby panda is almost 2 months old before it is the size of
                an average human newborn baby. A baby is almost 2 years old when it leaves its mother.
